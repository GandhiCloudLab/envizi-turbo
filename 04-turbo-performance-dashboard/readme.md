# Envizi - Turbonomic Performance Dashboard 

This document describes the Turbonomic Performance Dashboard in Envizi.

The Turbonomic Performance Dashboard allows to view and compare the energy and emissions performance of your data centers and assess the performance of deploying Turbonomic Resource Optimization technology.

## Dashboard Home

#### 1. Host Energy Consumption by Data Center

The dashboard shows the entire organizations energy and emission perspective. It shows the current year, previous year and Variance. The map shows the various Data Centres across the globe.

## Data Center Summary

A summary of a particular Data Center can be seen here.

#### 1. VM:Host Density vs Host Energy Consumption

It shows what the energy consumption of the host is and how it is changed over time by taking turbonomic action.

Here, the energy consumption was reduced from 243K to 171KÂ with a variance of 29%. This was the result of the action that was taken by the turbo. Correspondingly it reduces the amount of the emissions.

Also, it shows the month-on-month emissions over a period of time.

Active hosts are reduced from 55 to 40 based on Turbo actions.

#### 2. Energy:Host Intensity vs Host Energy Consumption

It depicts the energy intensity of the host versus the energy consumption of the host.
